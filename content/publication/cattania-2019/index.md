abstract: "
Small repeating earthquakes are thought to represent rupture of isolated asperities loaded by surrounding creep. The observed scaling between recurrence interval and seismic moment, $T_r$ ~ $M^{1/ 6}$, contrasts with expectation assuming constant stress drop and no aseismic slip ($T_r$ ~ $M^{1/ 3}$). Here we demonstrate that simple crack models of velocity-weakening asperities embedded in a velocity-strengthening fault predict the $M^{1/ 6}$ scaling; however, the mechanism  depends on asperity radius, $R$. For  small asperities ( $R\\_{\\infty} < R < 2R\\_{\\infty} $, where $R\\_{\\infty}$ is the nucleation radius) numerical simulations with rate-state friction show interseismic creep penetrating inwards from the edge, with earthquakes nucleating in the center and rupturing the entire asperity. Creep penetration accounts for ~$25\\%$ of the slip budget, the nucleation phase takes up a larger fraction of slip. Stress drop increases with increasing $R$; the lack of self-similarity due to the finite nucleation dimension. For $2 R\\_{\\infty}<R\\lesssim 4.3 R\\_{\\infty}$ simulations exhibit simple cycles with ruptures nucleating from the edge. Asperities with $R\\gtrsim 4.3R\\_{\\infty}$ exhibit complex cycles of partial and full ruptures. Here $T_r$ is explained by an energy criterion: full rupture requires that the energy release rate everywhere on the asperity at least equals the fracture energy, leading to the scaling $T_r$ ~ $M^{1/ 6}$. Remarkably, in spite of the variability in behavior with source dimension, the scaling of $T_r$ with stress drop $\\Delta\\tau$, nucleation length and creep rate $v\\_{pl}$ is the same across all regimes: $T_r$ ~ $\\sqrt{R\\_{\\infty}}\\Delta\\tau^{5/ 6}~M_0^{1/ 6}/v\\_{pl}$. This supports the use of repeating earthquakes as creepmeters, and provides a physical interpretation for the scaling observed in nature."
