Mathilde started in September 2018 at USC before moving to MIT summmer 2020.
Mathilde Wimez is a PhD student in the Tectonophysics group of the Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT. Her advisor is William B. Frank. She is working on the detection and characterization of Long Period Earthquakes in volcanic swarms. Her studies are located in Antarctica and in Kamchatka. At the mean time she works with Leigh Royden on the relation between dynamic pressure, depth and age of the Pacific’s sea floor. She is brodely interested in volcanism and mechanisms related to it (ex: seismology, magmatism, hydrology, glaciology).
