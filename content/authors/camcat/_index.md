Welcome! Iâ€™m an assistant professor in the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences](https://eapsweb.mit.edu) at MIT, where I am starting a research group on fault mechanics and earthquake physics.

I am currently looking for enthusiastic graduates students and postdocts. [Get in touch](mailto:camcat@mit.edu) if you're interested!

My group will address a range of questions at different scales, from the mechanics of small repeating events to earthquake interaction on regional and global scale. We will tackle these problems with a combination of numerical, analytical and statistical tools. In addition to furthering our understanding of earthquake physics, I am interested in ways to integrate the state-of-the-art knowledge into practical tools, and in particular models to use in operational earthquake forecasting.
